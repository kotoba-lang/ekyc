  "Parity between the .kotoba request-assembly core and the .cljc adapter.

  ADR-2608261100 vertical slice: `kotoba/production_provider_core.kotoba`
  carries the product semantics of `production_provider.cljc` — which
  endpoint each provider operation targets, with which HTTP method, and
  what rides in the body or the query. The .cljc oracle is NOT retired by
  this slice (it still owns the `reify` client and the `static-transport`
  host mechanism); this test only pins the agreement of the two on the
  same vectors.

  The compiled guest runs through the same KIR interpreter the crdt
  parity tests use; the single-module `compile-source` route is used
  here rather than `compile-project`, because project linking rejects
  `:schemas` declarations outright (amu b0095427, project.cljc). The
  host side calls the real `provider-client` through the protocol and
  reads the recorded request, so both implementations are exercised on
  the same inputs. Guest document encoding follows the KIR interpreter's
  admitted shape (see kotoba.kir.value/bounded-document!): [\"map\" ...]
  with plain keyword keys and tagged payloads."
